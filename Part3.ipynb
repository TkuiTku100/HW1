            "On August 17, 2017, Prince Charles visited Newton Stewart to inspect the damage caused by severe flooding in the area. The flooding had occurred a few weeks prior, on June 30, and had devastated the town, with many homes and businesses affected. The prince met with local residents, business owners, and emergency services personnel to offer his support and hear about their experiences during the flooding. He also viewed the ongoing recovery efforts and praised the resilience and community spirit of those affected. The visit brought attention and support to the town as it worked to recover and rebuild from the damage caused by the floods.\n",

            "What was Jeanette Tate's opinion about the multi-agency response to the flood?\n",
            "Jeanette Tate, the leader of the local council, was critical of the multi-agency response to the flood, stating that it was \"too little, too late.\" She argued that the response could have been more effective if the agencies had worked together in a more coordinated manner and had communicated better with the local community. Tate believed that the lack of coordination between agencies led to a delay in response time, which in turn led to greater damage and hardship for the affected residents. She advocated for a more unified and streamlined approach to disaster management, with clear lines of communication and a designated lead agency to oversee the response effort.\n",

            "What specific issue did Jeanette Tate highlight regarding flood prevention?\n",
            "Jeanette Tate highlighted the issue of inadequate flood prevention measures and the need for a more comprehensive approach to address flooding risks. She emphasized that simply building higher walls or larger drainage pipes was not a sustainable solution. Instead, she advocated for a holistic approach that takes into account the underlying causes of flooding, such as climate change, urban development, and environmental degradation. She suggested that effective flood prevention requires a combination of strategies, including improved water management, sustainable land use planning, and the restoration of natural floodplains and wetlands. By addressing these underlying issues, communities can become more resilient to flooding events and reduce the potential for future disasters.\n",

            "What did Alex Rowley emphasize as important for flood protection plans?\n",
            "Alex Rowley emphasized the importance of community engagement and collaboration in developing and implementing flood protection plans. He highlighted that effective flood protection requires the involvement and participation of local communities, as they have a deep understanding of the specific needs and challenges of their areas. By engaging with communities, authorities can ensure that flood protection measures are tailored to local contexts and that residents are empowered to take ownership of the plans, increasing their effectiveness and sustainability. Rowley also stressed the need for collaboration between different levels of government, agencies, and organizations to ensure a coordinated and holistic approach to flood protection. This includes sharing data, resources, and expertise to make informed decisions and develop comprehensive strategies that address the complex nature of flood risks.\n",
